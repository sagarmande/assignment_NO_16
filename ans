Here are the answers to your questions and the Python code to perform the requested tasks:

```python
# 1. Create a list called years_list
birth_year = 1990  # Replace with your birth year
years_list = [birth_year + i for i in range(6)]

# 2. Find the year of your third birthday
third_birthday_year = years_list[3]

# 3. Find the year when you were the oldest
oldest_year = max(years_list)

# 4. Make a list called things
things = ["mozzarella", "cinderella", "salmonella"]

# 5. Capitalize the element that refers to a person
things[1] = things[1].capitalize()

# 6. Make a surprise list
surprise = ["Groucho", "Chico", "Harpo"]

# 7. Lowercase, reverse, and capitalize the last element of the surprise list
surprise[-1] = surprise[-1].lower()[::-1].capitalize()

# 8. Make an English-to-French dictionary called e2f
e2f = {
    "dog": "chien",
    "cat": "chat",
    "walrus": "morse"
}

# 9. Find the French word for walrus in the dictionary
french_word_for_walrus = e2f["walrus"]

# 10. Make a French-to-English dictionary called f2e from e2f
f2e = {value: key for key, value in e2f.items()}

# 11. Print the English version of the French word "chien" using f2e
english_word_for_chien = f2e["chien"]

# 12. Make and print a set of English words from the keys in e2f
english_words_set = set(e2f.keys())

# 13. Make a multilevel dictionary called life
life = {
    "animals": {
        "cats": ["Henri", "Grumpy", "Lucy"],
        "octopi": {},
        "emus": {}
    },
    "plants": {},
    "other": {}
}

# 14. Print the top-level keys of life
top_level_keys = life.keys()

# 15. Print the keys for life['animals']
animal_keys = life["animals"].keys()

# 16. Print the values for life['animals']['cats']
cat_names = life["animals"]["cats"]

# Printing the results
print("1. years_list:", years_list)
print("2. Year of your third birthday:", third_birthday_year)
print("3. Year when you were the oldest:", oldest_year)
print("4. things:", things)
print("5. Capitalized person in things:", things[1])
print("6. surprise:", surprise)
print("7. Processed last element of surprise:", surprise[-1])
print("8. e2f:", e2f)
print("9. French word for walrus:", french_word_for_walrus)
print("10. f2e:", f2e)
print("11. English word for 'chien':", english_word_for_chien)
print("12. Set of English words:", english_words_set)
print("13. life:", life)
print("14. Top-level keys of life:", top_level_keys)
print("15. Keys for life['animals']:", animal_keys)
print("16. Values for life['animals']['cats']:", cat_names)
```

Make sure to replace `birth_year` with your actual birth year in the code.
